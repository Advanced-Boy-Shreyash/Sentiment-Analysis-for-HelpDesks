# How to Run this App

** Make sure you have Android Studio, Flutter and Dart installed. **

1. Open your terminal in the Executive App directory and the cd to the_executive by running:
```cd the_executive```

2. Enter your Gemini API key (on line no. 8) in the file:
```the_executive\lib\backend\gemini```

3. Now enter your bearer token or key (on line no. 25) for DeepGram API in the file :
```the_executive\lib\backend\api_requests```

4. One last time enter your same (which you used in Admin Panel) supabase credentials (on line no. 7, 8) in the file:
```the_executive\lib\backend\supabase```

5. Finally open the main.dart file and click on run button of Android Studio and run it in a browser or a virtual device.

I have already provided an APK file with this repository if you wanted to try directly on your Android Device.
